      <h1 class="w3-center">About Mental Health</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-center">---------------</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It encompasses the ability to manage stress, maintain fulfilling relationships, work productively, make rational decisions, and cope with life's challenges. Good mental health is vital for overall well-being and quality of life.</p>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Difference Between Mental Health and Mental Illness:</h1>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Mental health and mental illness are not the same. Mental health represents a state of emotional well-being, while mental illness refers to specific conditions that affect mental health negatively. Mental health is a continuum, with people varying in their mental well-being at different times. Mental illnesses include conditions like depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Having a mental illness does not mean one lacks mental health.
